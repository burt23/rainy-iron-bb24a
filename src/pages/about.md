This website was created with the vision of collecting, organizing, and sharing information for parents, educators, and students interested in early childhood special education. As a master's student studying early childhood special education, I find many valuable resources and websites. I thought a condensed research center may help others like myself. Therefore, I hope to create a website for curious people to connect to the many authors, researchers, and organizations that aim to improve the quality of education for young children with and without disabilities ranging from birth to five years old.
