    title: Sharing Resources for early childhood special educators
    content: >-
      This website highlights other educators, organizations, and programs
      within the field of early childhood special education. In the process, we
      aim to highlight resources that share foundational ideas about the
      importance of accepting all ability levels and nurturing a sense of
      belonging and community for young children and their families.

          The importance of representing people for all of their unique
          differences, and seeing those differences from positions of strength
          rather than deficit-based. This helps to develop a sense of curiousity
          towards other people and cultivating an awareness of others, without
          perpetuating historical narratives of marginalization that people from
          different backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, and abilities that
          people face.
